How to create a repository (project)?
  1. Create local and push to remote (github)
  2. Create on github and clone on local
  3. Clone a existing repository

What if web version (origin) is newer (ahead) of local version?
  %git remote -v
  # get name and urls for fetch and push locations

  % git remote show origin
  # shows what remote if any you are connected to and status
  # last line of my output says (local out of date)

  %git pull git@github.com:gregdyche/tepfaq.git
  #example to pull down changes for this repository
  #this info can be seen in the %git remote -v example above

Can I create an alias or shortcut for the remote?
  Yes.
  This is done by adding an additional remote.
  For example, I created a shortcut name, faq for my remote.
  %git remote add faq git@github.com:gregdyche/tepfaq.git

  Appears you can just use origin also, so I'm not sure how useful this is.

 What is the difference between 'fetch' and 'pull'?
  'fetch' just pull down the details about the info, metadata.
  Still need to merge to get the actual data.
  'pull' brings down the actual data.
